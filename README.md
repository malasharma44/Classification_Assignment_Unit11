Resampling and Ensemble Learning
### Final Questions I

1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
    It appears that the Naive Random Oversampling model, SMOTE oversampling model, and combination over and under sampling SMOTEENN model had similiar balanced accuracy scores.

2. Which model had the best recall score?
    It appears that the Naive Random Oversampling model, SMOTE oversampling model, and combination over and under sampling SMOTEENN model tied for best high risk recall scores.
    

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?
    It appears that the Naive Random Oversampling model, SMOTE oversampling model, and combination over and under sampling SMOTEENN model tied for best geometric mean scores.
    ### Final Questions II

1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

    It seems both models used had similar balanced accuracy scores, which could be an indicator of an error in the code.

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    It seems both models used had similar recall scores, which could be an indicator of an error in the code.

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?
    It seems both models used had similar geometric mean scores, which could be an indicator of an error in the code.

4. What are the top three features?
Based on the output of features listed in order of importance:
 (0.07150646379992939, 'total_rec_prncp'),
 (0.06912437127872893, 'last_pymnt_amnt'),
 (0.057854114463877955, 'total_rec_int', it seems the top three features are the following: "total_rec_prncp", "last_pymt_amnt", and "total_rec_int".
